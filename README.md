# Flask API Server!

### based on: https://damyanon.net/post/flask-series-structure/

To get set up on Windows:

```install Anaconda with python 3.6
conda create -n flask-server
activate flask-server
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



**Required packages:**
`flask`
`tensorflow`
`numpy`
`pandas`



An example of how to call TensorFlow models can be found in `./aihub/test_ml_model`

Be sure to edit the `./aihub/__init__.py` file accordingly if you are going to add more modules.

Once activating your environment, you can start the application by typing `python app.py`. 



Enjoy!
